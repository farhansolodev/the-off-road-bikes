<h2> Replaced select with Buttons (Use of Objects and JSON) </h2>
<p> Using flexbox really simplifies and organizes the structure of a particular section in a website. It is arguably better than the other layout options, such as inline and block, and this is due to the flexbox being a lot more flexible and easier to use. Basically, every div inside the flexbox can have a desired position and dimensions.</p>
<p> Flexbox layout is done in the CSS using 'display: flex;' and 'flex-direction:row' for a horizontal layout or column for vertical.</p>

<h2> CSS Animations: </h2>
<p>CSS animations are an effective way to provide user with feedback. The animations I used involve image size increase to get a better view of the image, background color changes when hovering over the item and changing the width of a textbox when clicking on it.</p>
<p>CSS animations can be done using 'transform', such as 'transition: transform .2s;', which determines the length of the animation. Then, pseudo classes such as ':hover' can be used to state the particular animation. For example 'transform: scale(1.2);', which increases the size of the image by 0.2.</p>
